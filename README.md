## Real_Time_Object_Detection
The problem being addressed in this project is object detection in images using the YOLOv5 algorithm. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately detect and localize objects in images, which can be used in various applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and robotics.

## Background
Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and has been extensively studied over the years. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that builds on the success of previous YOLO versions. It is a single-stage object detection algorithm that achieves high accuracy and fast inference times. The YOLOv5 algorithm uses a deep neural network that is trained on a large dataset of annotated images.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset that contains images with objects of interest labeled with bounding boxes. The dataset can be in any format supported by PyTorch's Dataset class. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor training progress, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Implementaion
The implementation uses PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The code is written in Python and is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for easy customization and extension. The implementation supports both single and multi-GPU training using PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) module.

## Output:
The model outputs bounding boxes around detected objects along with their class labels and confidence scores. The output can be visualized using various tools provided in the implementation.
